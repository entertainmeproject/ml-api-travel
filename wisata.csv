Pasar Tanah Abang,"Tanah Abang Market or Saturday Market was built by Yustinus Vinck on August 30 1735. Yustinus Vinck founded Tanah Abang Market with permission from Governor General Abraham Patramini. The permit given at that time for Tanah Abang Market was to sell textiles and grocery items and was only open every Saturday. Therefore, this market is called the Saturday Market. This market was able to compete with Senen Market (Welter Vreden) which was already advanced.\nIn 1740 the Chinatown Riot incident occurred, namely the massacre of Chinese people, destruction of property, including Tanah Abang Market which was ravaged and burned. In 1881, Tanah Abang Market was rebuilt and which was previously open on Saturdays, Wednesdays were added, so that Tanah Abang Market was opened twice a week. The market building was originally very simple, consisting of bamboo walls and planks and a thatched roof made of 229 planks and 139 bamboo plots. Tanah Abang Market continued to undergo improvements until the end of the 19th century and the floor began to be hardened with a mortar foundation. In 1913, Tanah Abang Market was repaired again. In 1926 the Batavian government demolished the Tanah Abang Market and replaced it with a permanent building in the form of three long stalls made of walls and boards and a tile roof, with the market office located on top of a market building similar to a birdcage. The parking lot in front of the market is a place to park the horses pulling the wagons and carts. There was a fairly large pool of water there, and across the road there was a shop that specialized in selling horse bran feed. A few tens of meters from the bran shop there is an alley known as Alley Madat, a place where compactors were localized.\nDuring the Japanese occupation, this market barely functioned, and became a place for homeless people.\nTanah Abang Market continued to develop after the construction of Tanah Abang Station.

This can be seen from the distinctive building details and ornaments that are identical to European style. Such as the extraordinarily large size of the doors and windows, the use of colored glass, the unique shape of the roof, and the existence of an underground room.

This fort has only one gate on its south side and five watchtowers. Each tower is named: Zeeland, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Raamsdonk and Bunschoten. The Dutch government moved the Chinese settlement in 1731 near the Dutch settlement, to make it easier to monitor all Chinese activities. Therefore, the Fort is not only a military center, but also a watchtower for all Chinese activities.\nThe Old City has become one of the favorite icons for the residents of Semarang City and even foreign countries also come to this Old City.
